    <!-- Exercise 1: Number Guessing Game -->

    <!-- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    Ask the user to guess the number using a prompt.
    If the user's guess is too high or too low, give them feedback.
    Keep asking the user for a guess until they guess the correct number.
    Once the user guesses correctly, congratulate them and tell them how many attempts it took. -->

    <!-- Bonus Challenge:
    Add a maximum number of attempts (like 10) and tell the user they lost if they exceed this number -->

    <!-- Output -->
    <!-- Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
    I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?
    Your guess: 50
    Too high! Try again.
    Your guess: 25
    Too low! Try again.
    Your guess: 30
    Congratulations! You've guessed the number in 3 attempts! -->
