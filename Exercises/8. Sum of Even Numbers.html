    <!-- Exercise 8: Sum of Even Numbers

    Objective: Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between two given numbers.

    Instructions:

    Ask the user for two numbers: a start number and an end number.
    Loop through all numbers between the start and end numbers (inclusive).
    If a number is even, add it to a running total.
    Display the total sum of all even numbers.
    Example:

    Input: Start number: 3, End number: 10
    Output: Sum of even numbers: 28 (because 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 28) -->


    <script>

        let Start = Number.parseInt(prompt("Enter Your First Number"))
        let End = Number.parseInt(prompt("Enter Your Second Number"))
        let sum = 0;
        for(let i = Start; i<=End; i++){
            if(i % 2 === 0){
                sum = sum + i
            }
        }
        console.log("Sum of your even numbers are:" + sum)

    </script>
