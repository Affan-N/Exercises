    <!-- Exercise 5: Find Prime Numbers

    Objective: Write a program that finds all prime numbers between two given numbers.

    Instructions:

    Ask the user for two numbers: a start number and an end number.
    Loop through all the numbers between the start and end numbers (inclusive).
    For each number, check if it is a prime number.
    Display all the prime numbers found.
    Hint:

    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
    You can check if a number n is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers from 2 to sqrt(n). -->

        let UserNum1 = Number.parseInt(prompt("Enter Your Start Number"))
        let UserNum2 = Number.parseInt(prompt("Enter Your End Number"))

        for(i = UserNum1; i<=UserNum2; i++){
            let isPrime = true;
            if(i < 2){
                isPrime = false;
            }

            for(j = 2; j<=i/2; j++){
                if(i % j === 0){
                    isPrime = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if(isPrime){
                console.log(i + " is the prime number") 
            }
