    <!-- Exercise 7: Fibonacci Sequence
    Objective: Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms.

    Instructions:

    Ask the user for the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence.
    The first two terms are always 0 and 1.
    Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.
    Display the generated Fibonacci sequence. -->

    <!-- Example Output:

    Input: 7
    Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 -->

        let UserInp = Number.parseInt(prompt("Enter your number"));

        let Current = 1;
        let result;

        for (let i = 0; i < UserInp; i++) {
            console.log(Previous); 
            result = Previous + Current;
            Previous = Current;
